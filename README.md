# InsightsAI Semantic Document Search Tool


## ⚠️ Important Note

**WARNING**: The actual code for this project is maintained on two separate branches:
1. Branch: `frontend` - Contains the React/Next.js UI implementation, components, and client-side logic
2. Branch: `backend` - Contains the Python FastAPI server, document processing logic, and database integration

Please make sure to check out the appropriate branch based on the component you're interested in.

## Overview

InsightsAI is an advanced semantic search tool that enables users to quickly find specific information across multiple documents. Using a priority-based approach to context extraction, the system delivers highly relevant search results even from large document collections. The intuitive interface makes document organization and searching seamless and efficient.

This repository contains the Alt-F4 team's submission for HackIndia Spark 3 2025.

## Core Features

- **Intelligent Document Processing** with priority-based context extraction
- **Powerful Semantic Search** supporting natural language queries
- **Interactive Document Zones** for prioritizing critical materials
- **User-Friendly Search Experience** with contextual results

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized as a monorepo with separate branches for frontend and backend components:

- **Main Branch**: Project overview and documentation
- **Frontend Branch**: React/Next.js implementation with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- **Backend Branch**: API implementation and document processing logic


## Getting Started

To explore the implementation details:

1. For frontend code and UI components:
   ```
   git checkout frontend
   ```

2. For backend services and API implementation:
   ```
   git checkout backend
   ```

Each branch contains its own README with specific setup instructions and architecture details.

## Technical Stack
